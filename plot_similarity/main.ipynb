      "Twelve years after the events described in Dune (1965), Paul \"Muad'Dib\" Atreides rules as Emperor.\n",
      "By accepting the role of messiah to the Fremen, Paul had unleashed a jihad which conquered most of the known universe.\n",
      "While Paul is the most powerful emperor ever known, he is powerless to stop the lethal excesses of the religious juggernaut he has created.\n",
      "Although 61 billion people have perished, Paul's prescient visions indicate that this is far from the worst possible outcome for humanity.\n",
      "Motivated by this knowledge, Paul hopes to set humanity on a course that will not inevitably lead to stagnation and destruction, while at the same time acting as ruler of the empire and focal point of the Fremen religion.\n",
      "The Bene Gesserit, Spacing Guild, and Tleilaxu enter into a conspiracy to dethrone Paul, and the Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam enlists Paul's own consort Princess Irulan, daughter of the deposed Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV.\n",
      "Paul has refused to father a child with Irulan (or even touch her), but his Fremen concubine Chani has also failed to produce an heir, causing tension within his monarchy.\n",
      "Desperate both to secure her place in the Atreides dynasty and to preserve the Atreides bloodline for the Bene Gesserit breeding program, Irulan has secretly been giving contraceptives to Chani.\n",
      "Paul is aware of this fact, but has foreseen that the birth of his heir will bring Chani's death, and does not want to lose her.\n",
      "He sees this in a terrifying vision of a moon that falls from the sky of Dune.\n",
      "Because of the way oracles interfere with one another's prescience, the Guild Navigator Edric is able to shield the conspiracy from Paul's visions of the future.\n",
      "The Tleilaxu Face Dancer Scytale gives Paul a gift he cannot resist: a Tleilaxu-grown ghola of the deceased Duncan Idaho, Paul's childhood teacher and friend, now called \"Hayt\".\n",
      "The conspirators hope the presence of Hayt will undermine Paul's ability to rule by forcing Paul to question himself and the empire he has created.\n",
      "Furthermore, Paul's acceptance of the gift weakens his support among the Fremen, who see the Tleilaxu and their tools as unclean.\n",
      "Chani, taking matters into her own hands, switches to a traditional Fremen fertility diet, preventing Irulan from being able to tamper with her food, and soon becomes pregnant.\n",
      "Otheym, one of Paul's former Fedaykin death commandos, reveals evidence of a Fremen conspiracy against Paul.\n",
      "Otheym gives Paul his dwarf Tleilaxu servant Bijaz, who like a recording machine, can remember faces, names, and details.\n",
      "Paul accepts reluctantly, seeing the strands of a Tleilaxu plot.\n",
      "As Paul's soldiers attack the conspirators, others set off an atomic weapon called a stone burner, purchased from the Tleilaxu, that destroys the area and blinds Paul.\n",
      "By tradition, all blind Fremen are abandoned in the desert, but Paul shocks the Fremen and entrenches his godhood by proving he can still see, even without eyes.\n",
      "His oracular powers have become so developed that he can foresee in his mind everything that happens, as though his eyes still function.\n",
      "By moving through his life in lockstep with his visions, he can see even the slightest details of the world around him.\n",
      "The disadvantage of this is his inability to change any part of his destiny, trapping him in a hellish boredom.\n",
      "The unraveling of the Fremen conspiracy reveals that Korba, a former Fedaykin and now high priest of Paul's church, is among Paul's enemies.\n",
      "Duncan interrogates Bijaz, but the little man—actually an agent of the Tleilaxu—uses a specific humming intonation that renders Duncan open to implanted commands.\n",
      "Bijaz programs Duncan to offer Paul a bargain when Chani dies: Chani's rebirth as a ghola, and the hope that Duncan Idaho's memories might be reawakened, in return for Paul sacrificing the throne and going into exile.\n",
      "Bijaz also implants a compulsion that will force Duncan to attempt to kill Paul, given the appropriate circumstances.\n",
      "Duncan remains oblivious of the programming.\n",
      "Eventually, news is brought that Chani has died giving birth.\n",
      "The grief of his loss is the falling moon that he foresaw in an earlier vision, and Paul stumbles, truly blind now, having removed himself from the prison of his own precise vision.\n",
      "Paul's reaction to his wife's death triggers the compulsions in the mind of Duncan, who attempts to kill Paul.\n",
      "Rather than kill his beloved Paul, though, Duncan's ghola body reacts against its own programming and recovers Duncan's full consciousness.\n",
      "He remains conscious of the Zen-Sunni and Mentat training given to Duncan by the Tleilaxu, but is no longer bound to their programming.\n",
      "Paul and Chani's newborn twins are \"pre-born\", like Paul's sister Alia had been, and come into the world fully conscious with Kwisatz Haderach-like access to ancestral memories thanks to a combination of their genes and an in utero exposure to the quantities of spice in Chani's special pregnancy diet.\n",
      "Scytale offers to revive Chani as a ghola in return for all of Paul's CHOAM holdings.\n",
      "Paul refuses to submit to the possibility that the Tleilaxu might program Chani in some diabolical way, and Scytale threatens the infants with a knife while he negotiates with Alia.\n",
      "By successfully escaping the oracular trap and setting the universe on a new path, Paul has been rendered completely blind, yet he is able to kill Scytale with an accurately aimed dagger due to a vision from his son's perspective.\n",
      "Now prophetically and physically blind, Paul chooses to embrace the Fremen tradition of a blind man walking alone into the desert, winning the fealty of the Fremen for his children, who will inherit his mantle of emperor.\n",
      "Paul leaves Alia, now romantically involved with Duncan, as regent for the twins, whom he has named Leto and Ghanima.\n",
      "Duncan notes the irony that Paul and Chani's deaths had enabled them to triumph against their enemies, and that Paul has escaped deification by walking into the desert as a man, while guaranteeing Fremen support for the Atreides line.\n",

      "Fifteen hundred years have passed since the 3,500-year reign of the God Emperor Leto II Atreides ended with his assassination; humanity is firmly on the Golden Path, Leto's plan to save humanity from destruction.\n",
      "By crushing the aspirations of humans for over three thousand years, Leto caused the Scattering, an explosion of humanity into the rest of the universe upon his death.\n",
      "Now, some of those who went out into the universe are coming back, bent on conquest.\n",
      "Only the Bene Gesserit perceive the Golden Path and are therefore faced with a choice: keep to their traditional role of hidden manipulators who quietly ease tensions and guide human progress while struggling for their own survival, or embrace the Golden Path and push humanity onward into a new future where humans are free from the threat of extinction.\n",
      "Much has changed in the millennium and a half since the death of the God Emperor.\n",
      "Sandworms have reappeared on Arrakis (now called Rakis) and renewed the flow of the all-important spice melange to the galaxy.\n",
      "With Leto's death, a very complex economic system built on spice collapsed, resulting in trillions leaving known space in a great Scattering.\n",
      "A new civilization has risen, with three dominant powers: the Ixians, whose no-ships are capable of piloting between the stars and are invisible to outside detection; the Bene Tleilax, who have learned to manufacture spice in their axlotl tanks and have created a new breed of Face Dancers; and the Bene Gesserit, a matriarchal order of subtle political manipulators who possess superhuman abilities.\n",
      "However, people from the Scattering are returning with their own peculiar powers.\n",
      "The most powerful of these forces are the Honored Matres, a violent society of women bred and trained for combat and the sexual control of men.\n",
      "On Rakis, a girl called Sheeana has been discovered who can control the giant worms.\n",
      "The Bene Gesserit intends to use a Tleilaxu-provided Duncan Idaho ghola to gain control of this sandrider, and the religious forces of humanity who they know will ultimately worship her.\n",
      "The Tleilaxu have altered the ghola to bring its physical reflexes up to modern standards.\n",
      "The Bene Gesserit leader, Mother Superior Taraza, brings Miles Teg to guard the new Idaho.\n",
      "Taraza also sends Reverend Mother Darwi Odrade to take command of the Bene Gesserit keep on Rakis.\n",
      "Odrade is a loose cannon; she does not obey normal Bene Gesserit prohibitions about love, and is also Teg's biological daughter.\n",
      "Bene Gesserit Imprinter Lucilla is also sent by Taraza to bind Idaho's loyalty to the Sisterhood with her sexual talents.\n",
      "However, Lucilla must deal with Reverend Mother Schwangyu, head of the ghola project but also the leader of a faction within the Bene Gesserit who feel the gholas are a danger.\n",
      "Above the planet Gammu, Taraza is captured and held hostage by the Honored Matres aboard an Ixian no-ship.\n",
      "The Honored Matres insist Taraza invite Teg to the ship, hoping to gain control of the ghola project.\n",
      "Teg manages to turn the tables on the Matres, and rescues the Mother Superior and her party.\n",
      "An attack is then made on Sheeana on Rakis, which is prevented by the intervention of the Bene Gesserit.\n",
      "Odrade starts training Sheeana as a Bene Gesserit.\n",
      "At about the same time an attempt is made on the life of Idaho, but Teg is able to defeat it.\n",
      "Teg flees with Duncan and Lucilla into the countryside.\n",
      "In an ancient Harkonnen no-globe, Teg proceeds to awaken Idaho's original memories, but does so before Lucilla can imprint Duncan and thus tie him to the Sisterhood.\n",
      "In the meantime, Taraza has been searching for Teg and his party, and finally establishes contact.\n",
      "During the operation, however, Teg and his companions are ambushed.\n",
      "Teg is captured while Lucilla and Duncan escape.\n",
      "Teg is tortured by a T-Probe, but under pressure discovers new abilities; one of them is to speed up his physical and mental reactions, which enables him to escape.\n",
      "At the same time, Idaho is ambushed and taken hostage.\n",
      "Taraza arranges a meeting with the Tleilaxu Master Waff, who is soon forced to tell her what he knows about the Honored Matres.\n",
      "When pressed on the issue of Idaho, he also admits that the Bene Tleilax have conditioned their own agenda into him.\n",
      "As the meeting draws to a close, Taraza accidentally divines that Waff is a Zensunni, giving the Bene Gesserit a lever to understand their ancient competitor.\n",
      "She and Odrade meet Waff again on Rakis.\n",
      "He tries to assassinate Taraza but Odrade convinces him that the Sisterhood shares the religious beliefs of the Bene Tleilax.\n",
      "Taraza offers full alliance with them against the onslaught of forces out of the Scattering.\n",
      "This agreement causes consternation among the Bene Gesserit, but Odrade realizes that Taraza's plan is to destroy Rakis.\n",
      "By destroying the planet, the Bene Gesserit would be dependent on the Tleilaxu for the spice, ensuring an alliance.\n",
      "Lucilla arrives at a Bene Gesserit safe house to discover it has been taken over by a young Honored Matre named Murbella, who has partially subdued Idaho.\n",
      "After being defeated in a quick bout of personal combat, Murbella assumes that Lucilla is the Great Honored Matre, and allows Lucilla and Burzmali to watch through the window of a locked room while she completes the sexual enslavement of the ghola.\n",
      "However, hidden Tleilaxu conditioning kicks in, and Duncan responds with an equal technique, one that overwhelms Murbella.\n",
      "Stunned and exhausted, Murbella dimly realizes that the man is the ghola they had been warned to search for, and unlocks the door to the room to gain Lucilla's assistance in killing him.\n",
      "But Lucilla says, \"We will kill no one.\n",
      "This ghola goes to Rakis\".\n",
      "The Honored Matres attack Rakis, killing Taraza.\n",
      "Odrade becomes temporary leader of the Bene Gesserit before escaping with Sheeana into the desert on a worm.\n",
      "Teg also goes to a supposed safe house, only to discover the Honored Matres.\n",
      "He unleashes himself upon the complex, before capturing a no-ship and locating Duncan and Lucilla.\n",
      "They and the captured Murbella are taken to Rakis with him.\n",
      "When they arrive, Teg finds Odrade and Sheeana and their giant worm.\n",
      "He loads them all up in his no-ship, finally leading his troops out on a last suicidal defense of Rakis, designed to attract the rage of the Honored Matres.\n",
      "The Honored Matres attack Rakis, destroying the planet and the sandworms except for the one the Bene Gesserit escape with.\n",
      "They intend to drown the worm in a mixture of water and spice, turning it into sandtrout which will turn the secret Bene Gesserit planet Chapterhouse into another Dune.\n",
